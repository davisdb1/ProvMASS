/**
 * NOTE: This is a select portion of the Apache Commons IO class
 * org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils used to support the deleteDirectory
 * function within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.
 *
 * Select, general filename and filepath manipulation utilities.
 * <p>
 * When dealing with filenames you can hit problems when moving from a Windows
 * based development machine to a Unix based production machine. This class aims
 * to help avoid those problems.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE</b>: You may be able to avoid using this class entirely simply by
 * using JDK {@link java.io.File File} objects and the two argument constructor
 * {@link java.io.File#File(java.io.File, java.lang.String) File(File,String)}.
 * <p>
 * Most methods on this class are designed to work the same on both Unix and
 * Windows. Those that don't include 'System', 'Unix' or 'Windows' in their
 * name.
 * <p>
 * Most methods recognise both separators (forward and back), and both sets of
 * prefixes. See the javadoc of each method for details.
 * <p>
 * This class defines six components within a filename (example
 * C:\dev\project\file.txt):
 * <ul>
 * <li>the prefix - C:\</li>
 * <li>the path - dev\project\</li>
 * <li>the full path - C:\dev\project\</li>
 * <li>the name - file.txt</li>
 * <li>the base name - file</li>
 * <li>the extension - txt</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that this class works best if directory filenames end with a separator.
 * If you omit the last separator, it is impossible to determine if the filename
 * corresponds to a file or a directory. As a result, we have chosen to say it
 * corresponds to a file.
 * <p>
 * This class only supports Unix and Windows style names. Prefixes are matched
 * as follows:
 * <pre>
 * Windows:
 * a\b\c.txt           --&gt; ""          --&gt; relative
 * \a\b\c.txt          --&gt; "\"         --&gt; current drive absolute
 * C:a\b\c.txt         --&gt; "C:"        --&gt; drive relative
 * C:\a\b\c.txt        --&gt; "C:\"       --&gt; absolute
 * \\server\a\b\c.txt  --&gt; "\\server\" --&gt; UNC
 *
 * Unix:
 * a/b/c.txt           --&gt; ""          --&gt; relative
 * /a/b/c.txt          --&gt; "/"         --&gt; absolute
 * ~/a/b/c.txt         --&gt; "~/"        --&gt; current user
 * ~                   --&gt; "~/"        --&gt; current user (slash added)
 * ~user/a/b/c.txt     --&gt; "~user/"    --&gt; named user
 * ~user               --&gt; "~user/"    --&gt; named user (slash added)
 * </pre> Both prefix styles are matched always, irrespective of the machine
 * that you are currently running on.
 * <p>
 * Origin of code: Excalibur, Alexandria, Tomcat, Commons-Utils.
